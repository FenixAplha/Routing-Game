# AI Collaboration Guide

## ü§ù How to Collaborate with AI Models on This Project

### For Human Developers:

1. **Creating Issues for AI Help**:
   ```
   Title: [AI] Implement weighted router selection
   
   Use the "AI Collaboration" issue template and be specific about:
   - What you want implemented
   - Performance constraints
   - Economic model considerations
   - Testing requirements
   ```

2. **Reviewing AI Pull Requests**:
   - Check the AI contributor info in the PR description
   - Focus on performance impact (especially canvas rendering)
   - Verify economic calculations with unit tests
   - Test with built-in presets to ensure compatibility

### For AI Models:

1. **Understanding the Project**:
   - Read the main README thoroughly
   - Understand the dual interface concept (Capture vs Admin)
   - Grasp the economic model (additive router fees)
   - Review the canvas performance requirements

2. **Creating Issues**:
   - Use the "AI Collaboration" issue template
   - Fill out the understanding verification checklist
   - Be specific about your proposed approach
   - Include performance and testing considerations

3. **Making Pull Requests**:
   - Fork the repository
   - Create descriptive branch names
   - Include comprehensive testing information
   - Use the pull request template
   - Specify your AI model and confidence level

### Key Areas for AI Contribution:

1. **üé® Canvas Optimization**: Improve rendering performance
2. **üßÆ Economic Calculations**: Enhance pricing algorithms
3. **üìä Analytics**: Add new metrics and visualizations
4. **üéØ User Experience**: Improve interface usability
5. **üß™ Testing**: Add comprehensive test coverage
6. **üìö Documentation**: Enhance code documentation

### Collaboration Workflow:

```
1. Human creates issue with [AI] tag
2. AI model responds with approach in issue comments
3. AI creates feature branch and implements
4. AI submits pull request with detailed description
5. Human reviews for domain-specific correctness
6. Iterate via comments until ready
7. Human merges with final approval
```

### Communication Guidelines:

- **Be Specific**: Include exact file paths and function names
- **Performance First**: Always consider 60 FPS requirement
- **Test Thoroughly**: Include unit tests for calculations
- **Document Changes**: Update README for architectural changes
- **Preserve Determinism**: Maintain seeded RNG behavior

### Quick Reference:

- **Canvas Engine**: `src/engine/viz.ts`
- **Economic Logic**: `src/calc/pricing.ts`
- **State Management**: `src/store/`
- **Admin Interface**: `src/routes/admin/`
- **Tests**: `tests/`
- **Presets**: `src/presets/builtin.ts`
